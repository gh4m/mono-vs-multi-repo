# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Purpose

This is a documentation project that explores and compares monorepo versus multi-repo architectural patterns. The goal is to provide comprehensive analysis of the pros, cons, trade-offs, and use cases for each approach.

## Documentation Structure

- All documentation is written in Markdown (.md) format
- Content is organized into separate files, not one monolithic document
- Each major topic should have its own dedicated file
- Use a logical directory structure to organize related topics
- Link between documents to create a navigable documentation site

## Content Organization Guidelines

When adding or editing documentation:
- Focus on objective comparisons backed by real-world examples
- Include practical considerations (tooling, CI/CD, team structure, scaling)
- Cite specific tools and frameworks (e.g., Nx, Turborepo, Lerna for monorepos)
- Cover both technical and organizational perspectives
- Include case studies from companies using each approach when relevant
- Keep individual files focused on specific topics
- Use cross-references to connect related concepts

## Key Topics to Cover

- Definition and characteristics of each pattern
- Advantages and disadvantages
- Tooling ecosystems
- CI/CD implications
- Code sharing and dependency management
- Team collaboration and ownership models
- Versioning and release strategies
- Performance and build optimization
- Migration considerations

# Environment Status and Deployments

Outline how to track which versions of which artifacts are running in each environment.

Suggested sections:

- Recording deployments in an external system of record (for example, database, deployment tool)
- Capturing environment, artifact name, version, commit, and timestamp
- Dashboards for “what is running where?”
- Handling drift and rollback scenarios

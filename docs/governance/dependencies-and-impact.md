# Dependencies and Impact Analysis

Explain how to understand and report on relationships between apps, libraries, and shared components.

Suggested sections:

- Extracting dependency graphs from build tools (for example, Nx, Bazel, Turborepo)
- Mapping code dependencies to business domains and teams
- Answering “what depends on X?” and “what breaks if X changes?”
- Using dependency data to plan migrations and risk assessments

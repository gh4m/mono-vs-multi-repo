# Catalog and Metadata

Explain how to maintain an accurate inventory of everything in the repo and related systems.

Suggested sections:

- Per-project metadata files (for example, `apps/*/project.yml`, `libs/*/project.yml`)
- Fields such as owners, domains, risk level, SLAs, and tags
- Generating a central catalog (for example, Backstage, custom service catalog)
- How CI updates the catalog based on builds and deployments

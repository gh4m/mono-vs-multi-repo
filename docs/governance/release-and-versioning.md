# Release and Versioning

Describe how individual apps and libraries are versioned and released from a shared repository.

Suggested sections:

- Per-artifact versioning (for example, `app-foo@1.2.0`, `lib-bar@3.4.1`)
- Tagging conventions and changelog generation
- Grouped releases versus independent releases
- How release pipelines publish artifacts and register new versions

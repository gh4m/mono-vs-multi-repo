# Examples

This directory is reserved for small, focused examples that illustrate specific monorepo or multi-repo patterns.

Guidelines:

- Group examples by language or tool (for example, `examples/javascript/`, `examples/nx/`).
- Keep each example self-contained with a short `README.md` describing the scenario and how to run it.
- Use realistic but minimal code and configuration to highlight the architectural point, not full application logic.
